/*
 * jbittorrent library is an implementation in Java language of BiTorrent protocol.
 *
 * It is based on the Java Bittorrent API of Baptiste Dubuis, Artificial Inteligency Laboratory, EPFL.
 * @version 1.0
 * @author Baptiste Dubuis
 * To contact the author:
 * email: baptiste.dubuis@gmail.com
 *
 * More information about Java Bittorrent API:
 * http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitext/
 *
 * New contribution are:
 * 1. Optimization of process establishement of conecctions betwen the peers of the swarm.
 * 2. Improvements in the Choking Algorithm.
 * 3. Improvements in the Optimistic Unchoking implementation.
 * 4. Implementation of Rarest First algorithm .
 * 5. Implementation of End Game Strategy.
 *
 * This project contains three packs:
 * 1. jbittorrent is the "client" part, i.e. it implements all classes needed to publish files, share them and download them.
 * 2. trackerBT is the "tracker" part, i.e. it implements all classes needed to run a Bittorrent tracker that coordinates peers exchanges.
 * 3. test contains example classes on how a developer could create new applications and new .torrent file.
